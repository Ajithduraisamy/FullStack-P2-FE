# Todo List App (Frontend)

This is the frontend of the Todo List application, built using React.js. The app allows users to register, log in, and manage their tasks (create, edit, and delete tasks). The frontend communicates with a Node.js and Express backend, which handles authentication, task storage, and CRUD operations.

**Features**

  1. User registration and login.
  2. Secure JWT-based authentication.
  3. Task creation, editing, deletion, and viewing.
  4. Fully responsive design using Bootstrap.
  5. Task management with real-time updates.
  6. JWT token handling for API requests to the backend.

**Tech Stack**
  1. React.js: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.
  2. Bootstrap: For responsive design and UI styling.
  3. Axios: For making API requests to the backend.
  4. JWT: For handling authentication tokens.

**Usage**
  1. Register a new user or log in to your existing account.
  2. After logging in, the task management interface will allow you to create new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks.
  3. Log out using the "Logout" button once you're done.
